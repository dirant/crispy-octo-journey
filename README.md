Fill your github history with unverifiable experience. Just to prove HR wrong!

## Usage
* Create a new private repo, name it whatever you like
* Download this as a zip
* Unzip the code in the root of the repo
* `npm i`
* `node index.js`
* Enjoy

## Why?
You can't jugde a dev's experience solely from their GitHub history. Some of us just work for private companies with code they are not allowed to share.
So if you're reading this you probably understand the situation, but if you're not reading this, you probably deserve to be fooled by the huge amount of "contributions"
